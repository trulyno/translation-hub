## üîß Technical Implementation

### Authentication System

The application implements a client-side Discord OAuth2 flow specifically designed for static hosting environments:

#### Key Files and Components

**Core Authentication:**
- **`src/lib/auth.js`** - Discord OAuth2 configuration, guild membership verification, and role determination
- **`src/lib/stores.js`** - Svelte stores for user state, authentication, and role management
- **`src/routes/auth/callback/+page.svelte`** - OAuth callback handler with role assignment
- **`src/lib/components/Navigation.svelte`** - Role-based navigation component

**Application Pages:**
- **`src/routes/+page.svelte`** - Central dashboard with role-based navigation menu
- **`src/routes/view/+page.svelte`** - Translation browser (accessible to all users)
- **`src/routes/edit/+page.svelte`** - Translation editing interface (contributors/admins)
- **`src/routes/verify/+page.svelte`** - Translation verification workflow (contributors/admins)
- **`src/routes/management/+page.svelte`** - User management system (admins only)

**Configuration:**
- **`.env`** - Environment variables including admin user IDs and Discord configuration
- **`src/app.d.ts`** - TypeScript definitions (cleaned up)

#### Deployment Configuration

- **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`** - Updated to use VITE\_ environment variables
- **`svelte.config.js`** - Optimized for static deployment
- **`.env` and `.env.example`** - Client-side environment configuration

#### Authentication Flow

1. **User clicks "Sign in with Discord"**
2. **Redirect to Discord OAuth** - User authorizes the application
3. **Callback with authorization code** - Discord redirects back with code
4. **Demo simulation** - For demo purposes, we simulate user data
5. **Session storage** - User info saved to localStorage
6. **UI updates** - Reactive interface shows user profile

### Environment Configuration

#### Development Environment

```env
# .env file for local development
VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_discord_secret_here
VITE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173/auth/callback
VITE_APP_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Guild Configuration
VITE_DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_guild_id_here

# Admin User IDs (comma-separated Discord user IDs)
VITE_ADMIN_USER_IDS=admin_user_id_1,admin_user_id_2
```

#### Production Environment

```env
# Environment variables injected during GitHub Actions build
VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=${DISCORD_CLIENT_ID}
VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=${DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET}
VITE_REDIRECT_URI=https://username.github.io/translation-hub/auth/callback
VITE_APP_URL=https://username.github.io/translation-hub
VITE_DISCORD_GUILD_ID=${DISCORD_GUILD_ID}
VITE_ADMIN_USER_IDS=${ADMIN_USER_IDS}
```

### How It Works

The system demonstrates a complete Discord OAuth2 integration with guild membership verification optimized for static hosting:

1. **User Interaction**: Click "Sign in with Discord" button
2. **OAuth Redirect**: Browser navigates to Discord authorization URL with guild permissions
3. **User Authorization**: User approves application permissions including guild access
4. **Callback Processing**: Discord redirects to `/auth/callback` with authorization code
5. **Guild Membership Check**: Application verifies user's guild membership and join date
6. **Role Assignment**: User role determined based on:
   - Admin status (from environment variable user IDs)
   - Guild membership duration (1+ months = contributor)
   - Default guest role for non-members or recent members
7. **State Management**: User information and role stored in reactive Svelte stores
8. **UI Updates**: Interface dynamically updates with role-based navigation and access
9. **Page Protection**: Automatic access control and redirects based on user role

### Build and Deployment Configuration

#### GitHub Actions Workflow

The deployment process is automated through GitHub Actions:

- **Environment Variable Injection**: Discord Client ID is securely injected from GitHub Secrets
- **Static Build**: Application is built as a static site optimized for GitHub Pages
- **Automated Deployment**: Push to main branch triggers automatic deployment

#### SvelteKit Configuration

The application is configured for static site generation:

```javascript
// svelte.config.js
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';

const config = {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter({
			pages: 'build',
			assets: 'build',
			fallback: 'index.html'
		})
	}
};
```

## üé≠ Role-Based Access Control

### User Roles

The application implements a three-tier role system:

#### üîí Guest Role
- **Access**: View page only
- **Requirements**: No authentication required
- **Permissions**: Browse and view translations, no editing capabilities
- **UI Elements**: Limited navigation menu, sign-in prompt

#### üë• Contributor Role  
- **Access**: View, Edit, and Verify pages
- **Requirements**: Discord authentication + 1+ month guild membership
- **Permissions**: View, edit, and verify translations
- **UI Elements**: Full navigation except management features

#### üëë Admin Role
- **Access**: All pages including Management
- **Requirements**: Discord user ID listed in `VITE_ADMIN_USER_IDS` environment variable
- **Permissions**: All contributor permissions + user management and role revocation
- **UI Elements**: Complete navigation menu with management access

### Role Determination Logic

```javascript
// From src/lib/auth.js
export function determineUserRole(userId, guildMember) {
	// Check if user is admin
	if (discordConfig.adminUserIds.includes(userId)) {
		return 'admin';
	}

	// Check if user is guild member for more than 1 month
	if (guildMember && hasBeenMemberLongEnough(guildMember.joined_at)) {
		return 'contributor';
	}

	// Default role
	return 'guest';
}
```

### Page Access Control

Each page implements automatic access verification:

- **Unauthorized Access**: Users are redirected to the main dashboard
- **Role Checking**: Real-time verification of user permissions
- **UI Adaptation**: Navigation and features adapt based on current role
- **Persistent Sessions**: Role information maintained across browser sessions

## üîê Security Implementation

### Current Security Measures

- **No Sensitive Secrets in Code**: Only Discord Client ID is used client-side (safe to expose)
- **GitHub Secrets**: Credentials stored securely in repository settings
- **Build-time Injection**: Environment variables injected during CI/CD without exposure
- **Client-Side Safety**: No client secret required for public OAuth applications

### Security Considerations

#### ‚úÖ What's Secure

- Discord Client ID is designed to be public and safe to expose
- GitHub Secrets provide encrypted storage for build-time variables
